# cgichk
This is a VERY old command line tool for probing around websites looking for open directories. 

Generally used just for snooping around where you really _shouldn't_ be, or making sure your own sites aren't exposing anything unintentionally.

Cgichk is from a much older time. I barely remember anything about it, and I certainly don't recognize the code. 

Hell, I can't even remember if I wrote this from scratch back in the day, or if I modified someone elses code! 

How do you like that?! ;)


**UPDATE:** Just had to peek inside the main file to get answer that one: nope, I forked this from a tool called "CGI Checker" by a dude named "su1d sh3ll".

The original code was written by fdisk (me) in cooperation with a Chinese developer named CKS back in 1999 (if memory serves me right). Su1dSh3ll later forked the code from fdisk and CKS and modified it but never gave the credit initially. He, was later forced to do so, thus the bitter message that is present in the README file of the latest release in [https://packetstorm.news/files/id/22817](https://packetstorm.news/files/id/22817)
